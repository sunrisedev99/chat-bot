Hello Client, I am so glad to meet you.



Thank you for considering my application for your travel fee calculation program.
I am looking forward to the chance to work together and create a solution that meets your needs perfectly.



Here's how I would approach this project:



1. Distance Calculation
I will utilize the Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap API to calculate the distance between addresses. This will ensure accurate distance measurements.
-Obtain Coordinates for Addresses
Departure address: Headquarters location.
Destination Address: The address where the service is requested.



I will use a geocoding API such a Google Maps API to convert these addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates.



-Calculate Distance
I will use the latitude and longitude coordinates of both addresses to calculate the distance between them.
The Haversine formula is commonly used for this calculation. It computes the great-circle distance between two points on the Earth's surface, given their latitudes and longitudes.



2. Fee Calculation Logic
I will develop a Python backend to process the distance data and apply the appropriate fee based on your tiered structure.
-Determine the Fee Based on Distance
I can compare the calculated distance with the defined distance ranges.
And then I can used the fee structure to determine the appropriate travel fee based on the distance range in which the distance falls.



3. User Interface
I will create a web-based interface using JavaScript frameworks such as React or Angular where you can enter addresses and view travel fees.
Thank you for reviewing my proposal.



I am confident that my expertise and approach will deliver a solution that meets your needs effectively.



Best regards.

How much would it cost in total ?

Antonii Roh 7:56 PM
Hi Mathew,
I think it takes about 17 ~ 23 hours totally.



- UI interface (16 ~ 20 hours)
- API integration (1~3 hours)



the rate I suggest for this project is $36 so total cost is $616 ~ $828.

This cost is just estimation, and it is flexible, we can discuss more if you'd like.

Will this be web based ?

I have a bunch of different locations

I want it ro realize where itâ€™s entered and calculate Cloests

Closest point

Antonii Roh 2:47 PM
Yeah, it will,
By following these steps, I an create a web-based application that calculates travel fees based on the distance to the closest HQ location, providing a user-friendly experience for your catering company.



1. I will design UI Components like this.
-Address Input: A form to enter the address.
-HQ Location Selector: Dropdown to select the HQ location.
-Results Display: Show calculated travel fee and closest HQ location.
2. As I mentioned before, I will integrate Google Maps API for address
auto-completion and implement geocoding to convert the address to coordinates.
3. These are API Endpoints to build this project.
Geocode, calculate-distance, calculate-fee.
4. I will use MongoDB and create a data base to store HQ locations with their coordinates.



I will use React.js for a dynamic user interface and I recommend redux as React library.
I will use Node.js with Express.js and Python for server-side logic.
That's all
I will wait for your reply.

Hi Mathew
How are you?

I am ready for interview.

I just created google meet link for that.

Antonii Roh 3:23 PM
Hi

Antonii Roh 4:16 PM
I am available now.

Antonii Roh 5:24 PM
When I think about it again.
If you are going to use the program on your own, I think APP program would be better than WEB program.
In my opinion app program is more convenient than web program.
So if you want app program, I will build your project using C# based on my rich C# experiences.

Okay,

Just checked, it's enough to start.

Please make contract so that I can jump

Matthew Miller 5:28 AM
I neber got proposal

I would like to start

Antonii Roh 5:57 AM
Oh, as you can see my profile, my default hourly rate is $45 and the rate I bided is $36, the estimated work time is 23 hours.

So total cost is $828 ~ $1035

You can make fixed price offer in range of them.

Antonii Roh 8:39 AM
Hi Matthew

Antonii Roh 9:56 AM
Are you busy?

Antonii Roh 10:02 AM
I have currently established a development environment and am on the initial project structuring stage. Btw we need a Google map api key to test project.
Of course I can use my own key but it needs for production stage.

Also please check my proposal out and make offer asap

Looking to have a program made where I can enter a location and it will calculate if there is a travel fee. I own a catering company across the us and want to be able to enter dress from my Hq and see if thereâ€™s a fee .
Have multiple across the country
Example
NY addess ( main location)
Under 50 miles no travel fee
50-74 miles 50 $ travel fee
75-99 75 $ travel feel
100-149 100$ travel fee
150 plus 150$ travel fee

Rate: $36.00/hr

Rate Increase: None

Limit: 25 hrs/week

Please let me know if you can finish today

Hibachi2u is my company name

Antonii Roh 4:42 PM
Thank you for your offer.
Currently, I am working hard.
I will try.

Antonii Roh 6:42 PM
Hi, I just built beta version of this project so I need to test.
Please share your google api key(google geocoding api key and google map api key)

And also Please send me Distance matrix api key so that I can test beta project.

Antonii Roh 7:58 PM
If you don't have any experiences in creating API key, you can refer this URL.

I need Google API keys immediately to test our project.

Antonii Roh 5:45 PM
The project is now in the completion stage.
All basic functions have been completed.



I will send the result asap, but I need your Google API key.
I'm using my Google API key now, but app doesn't work if it is expired further in my side.



Btw, I need your questions you needed during development.
I think your response is a bit slow because your are very busy and our time zone is different each other.



So, if you tell me the communication channel you frequently use, I will contact you through that.



If you finish seeing my working video, please contact me and send me your communication channel if you don't mind.



Thank you.

Hi, It's good news! Did you check the video I sent?

I'd like to call you for your feedback.

Also please make the Google API key and send it to me.

Matthew Miller 7:17 AM
It would have to be customers address entere

Entered

Iâ€™m unfimiliar with how to do that I just made a google. Cloud account

I would need the closest hq to pop up

And if possible maybe make it look more modern if possible with my logo on it

Are you feeling bad?
I make a apologies for my behavior.

hope all is well is it done o Mac yet ?

Antonii Roh 3:32 PM
I think you did not say I work on it continuously.
And we did not discuss the budget for Mac yet.
Is the windows version works well?

Matthew Miller 3:37 PM
I can't use it

I only have Mac

budget ?

that's what I hired you for

Antonii Roh 3:43 PM
You said you want to your employees use it on Windows.
And you didn't explain your requirements that you want to use it on Mac,
So I developed the windows version first as app development's workflow.



Therefore for Mac, we need to discuss the additional budget.
