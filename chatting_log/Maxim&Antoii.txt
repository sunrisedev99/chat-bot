Hi Maxim
I just check the PoC for MoE(google doc and video), this idea is fantastic.



Before getting start, I have a question.
I met many clients to build AR product btw they have used OpenCV library for their projects so I skilled in OpenCV.



Could you let me know in detail why you should use ocean library for your project?
It would be very helpful if you give answers to me for that.



No worries, I can start immediately when you hire me.

Antonii Roh 2:59 PM
Good morning, Maxim.
There are so many developers but not so many suitable ones for your task.
I have just finished the analyzing about your task completely.
Just give me a ring as soon as you possible.
I always ready...

that's what need to be used

Ocean
it's new library

Antonii Roh 8:07 AM
Make sense. Could you let me know the deadline for this project?

Antonii Roh 8:15 AM
I have seen your upwork profile so I knew you are senior full stack web developer and designer.
As a AI & App developer, I can help with you if you have such jobs.



I do hope to work with you with good relationship.

Maxim Todorov 11:11 PM
Hi

We don't have a strict deadline here, we need to get PoC
if there is any part that looks hard we can remove it

Antonii Roh 11:34 PM
Okay, if you hire me, I will build that source and proof your idea with my passion.

Maxim Todorov created a Zoom meeting

Great

so you have seen the documentation and our google doc

can we try to build small mvp?

Can we start from this small part



Loading and Rendering the Model
Using the Ocean Framework, I'll load the MoE 3D model and set up the scene, including camera positioning and lighting. If no ones speaks for a certain amount of time, Moe dissapears.



just to make sure we can work together
