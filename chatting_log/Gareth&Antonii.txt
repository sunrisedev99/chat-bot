Hello Antonii, I hope you are doing well.
I am interested to discuss your application to this post

Antonii Roh 7:44 PM
Hi Gareth,
Thank you for your kind response.

Antonii Roh 8:16 PM
In my previous project, I have had experience working with Leaflet.js to develop interactive and user-friendly map applications.



This project involved implementing advanced features such as dynamic layer controls, real-time data updates, and custom marker clusters.



These are some key highlights from my experience with Leaflet.js



- Custom Map Layes
I developed and integrated various custom map layers to display different types of data, including heat maps and choropleth maps.



- Interactive Features
I have implemented interactive features such as drawing tools, pop-ups, and custom controls to allow users to interact with the map data more effectively.

Gareth Clark 8:17 PM
I'm just pulling together some additional details and I will send through

Antonii Roh 8:18 PM
Okay.
I will wait.

Hello Antonii, thank you for providing this and it demonstrates a clear understanding of the task from your side.
Do you have an estimation for me on the time investment in this?

Antonii Roh 11:46 PM
I estimated this approximately 35 ~ 45 hours over a week or 10 days.
This is only estimate but it may be adjusted along the way.



Thank you for your consideration.

Gareth Clark 11:48 PM
Hi Antonii, this works for me

Given that this is currently built into Odoo and you have not worked with Odoo before, how can i assist you with accessing the solution and testing etc?

I will give you access to the code base but it is built into a module for Odoo, so i'm not sure if you have a way to work on it outside of the Odoo platform or you will need to deploy Odoo to test it inside of the platform

I do have developers working full time in our company who can always assist you with the Odoo side of things

You can provide me with your github name and I can add you into the repository where you can take a look

Ok course it is late now, so we can also sort everything tomorrow if it is better for you

Antonii Roh 11:54 PM
You could provide me with access to a development or staging Odoo environment where I can work on the map drawing tool module.
This could be through a cloud-based Odoo instance.

Gareth Clark 11:55 PM
Ok, we have this and will provide for you

Antonii Roh 11:57 PM
Okay, if you send me the offer, I will prepare the environment to start working from tomorrow.

Hi, Gareth.
Sorry for interrupt you but just a question.
Could you possibly tell me about the version of the python for this project?

Good morning Antonii, I hope you had a good weekend. I just wanted to check in on if you had any updates here for me.

Antonii Roh 9:41 AM
Good morning Gareth.
Did you have a good weekend?



I have already finished the first task and committed the updated code to Github, and upgraded the CRM_Dashboard and Drawing tool modules.
Please check it out and let me know your suggestion.

Antonii Roh 2:40 PM
Hi Gareth,
Have you checked the code I committed?

Gareth Clark 3:16 PM
Hi Antonii, I have not had time yet today. Most probably tomorrow morning I will have time to check it

Be sure to carry on with other items in the meantime

Antonii Roh 3:28 PM
Okay Got it,
I will work continuously.

Just with the bold, underlines options etc. Would it be possible to do them as icon like in a normal toolbar?

Like these type of icons you can just select on and off. I think that will make it more user friendly as people will be used to see those type of icons and know immedaitely what it is

Antonii Roh 12:29 AM
Yes. I understand. I will fix it.
If you have any ideas more, please feel free to suggest at any time.
Thank you.

Gareth Clark 12:37 AM
At the moment the priority is to get all the functionality running ASAP, after that we can work to make smaller improvements, but it would be great to get as much as possible of the features in place quickly

Antonii Roh 1:04 AM
Okay, Got it.
I have researched the environment and figured the project out, so it took some time.
But because I have already implemented the first features, so I can implement the rest features asap.



I will update immediately as progress is made.



Than you.

Good morning, Gareth.
How are you?



While developing in a local environment, I have encountered a few issues on the map drawing page that I'd like your assistance with
1. The Fence product list is not displayed.
2. The material list by Fence is not displayed.
3. The Cable/Pipe list is not displayed.



Please check the screens below and let me know why this data is not appearing on the drawing page.

Are you working off of a database dump that I provided or you created a new database?

Antonii Roh 12:18 PM
I created a new database.
And excuse me, what is the database dump you provided?

Gareth Clark 12:21 PM
Ok, so it will not work on new database because you have no products created and so they cannot appear there

I can send you a database dump from an instance that have everything setup if you want to use that to test locally

Antonii Roh 12:22 PM
Please send me.

Thank you.
I will check it and connect you again.üòä

Gareth Clark 10:59 PM
Hi Antonii, did you manage to use this database dump and did it resolve the issues you were having? I'm still hoping we can make some good progress this week

Wednesday, Jul 31
Antonii Roh 1:50 AM
Hello Gareth,
Just pushed 2nd task I completed.
In fact, I tried to build the local development environment again using the database dump file you provided, but error occurred due to compatibility issues with odoo version('m using v14 default framework). So I have imported only the tables containing the relevant with crm_dashboard into a new database, but the error still occurred. so I need overall framework to make same environment in my local.



Thus I didn't get message here when I working today so to improve my responsibility, it would be nice if you share another contact info for quick response and smooth communication.



Best regards,

Antonii Roh 4:50 AM
Good morning, Gareth.
Maybe you are in bed and I apologize disturbed you.
I committed to the third item and I 'm working on the fourth item now.

Gareth Clark 8:21 AM
Great, its looking good thanks. There are a few polishing points that I would make but i think lets push and get all functionality in place and then I will do a complete run through and give you any changes that I want made at the end

Gareth Clark 9:57 PM
Hi Antonii, just to say that in the last code that you have pushed through there seems to now be an issue with the text box

https://www.loom.com/share/3823d21abbc44cb1a70706fdc6c510d6


Gareth Clark 10:54 PM
All the other changes are top-notch so far, thank you very much for the good work.
Once everything is through I will have an in-depth call with the client and review if there are some changes to be made here and there, but so far its all looking good

Antonii Roh 1:41 AM
Hi Gareth,
Thank you for your good review of my work.
I am sorry to forgot tell you after I pushed the modified code.



I am working continuously for rest items.
I will do my best to complete it asap.



Thank you.



*Oh, one more asking...
When I am working, I cannot your message here, so it would be great that tell me your quick communication info.

Antonii Roh 6:20 PM
Hi Gareth,
How are you?

I just pushed the 3 other items.
I am working continuously now.



Please check it out and let me know.

Gareth Clark 11:29 PM

Antonii Roh 12:02 AM

Antonii Roh 12:10 AM
