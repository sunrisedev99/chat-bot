Is everything going well? Any issues or questions?"

Antonii Roh 1:28 PM
Good morning. Now I am working on it.



There are some issues during the working but I am solving them well.



For example, there are many blocker to scrape the data in Guns.com. But I made lots of progress.
Maybe I send the some result if you'd like.

Nick Sawinyh 1:36 PM
Thanks. When you have the dataset for guns.com ready, send it via API.

Antonii Roh 1:38 PM
Okay.

Wednesday, Jul 24
Nick Sawinyh 1:39 PM
It would be great if you could upload some results via API, as you have a scrapper going.

Antonii Roh 1:45 PM
Good morning

Now I am gathering the data. I will send the data via API that you suggested today.



Maybe it will take some time.
It is okay for you?

Nick Sawinyh 2:43 PM
yeah

Antonii Roh 2:57 PM
But I have a question now. I scraped some data from Guns.com. But when I send the data via API that you provided, I have to send a request every product. It will take long time.
Of course, it will take long time even to get all data from Guns.com.



As a matter of fact, as you know the estimated time is exceeding.
So I am working hard to send the correct and reliable data doing my best.



I will contact you as soon as I have done.
